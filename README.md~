tictactoe_solver
================

Java program that can determine the outcome of a Tic Tac Toe game. 

It reads in a text file that represents the state of a current game (the game board). The first line should 
contain the number of boards in the file. The next line then contains the next player, X or O, represented using
that character. The next 3 lines represent the board again using X, O and an underscore for a blank spot.
The next player for the second board is on the next line, and so on.

Results go to standard out.

Example with 2 boards:

2
X
X_X
OXO
XO_
O
XOX
__O
X_O
